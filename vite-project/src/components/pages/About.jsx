               My name is Jorge Alcala and i am 19 years old. I was born in Mission Hills and was raised in La and riverside. I was never really interested in coding until I decided to take cyber security during my junior year in high school. During my time there, I learned python and then procceded to learn other languagues like HTML, CSS, and javascript. After graduating high school I decided to enroll myself in a coding bootcamp where I was taught Frontend and Backend.
